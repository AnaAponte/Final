<h2>What is HTML&CSS?</h2>
<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.It is a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.</p>

<h2>So then What is ruby?</h2>
<p> A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.</p>

<h2>And then Python is?</h2>
<p>Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.</p>

<h2>What I enojyed in this class...</h2>
<p>What I enjoyed in this class was the all the different types of learning that was done along with the joy of finally see all the hardwork pay off when you finally got the code correct.</p>

<h2>What I disliked in class...</h2>
<p>What I disliked in this class was the testing time restraint. There was so much to learn in such a short time frame. Also all the frustration that came with trying out new things and continuously having to fix it and even then sometimes it wouldnt work so you had to change it again and again.</p>
